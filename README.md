Creating a show storage "app" to practice DOM manipulation in JavaScript


*Easily track shows you've watch, are currently watching or plan on watching.

- Add shows to your local storage.
- Remove shows from your local storage.
- View a list of your saved shows.
- Search a show in your list.
- Random a show from your list.

This app was built so I could pratice DOM manipulation and HTML element creating with vanilla JavaScript, use of XML with APIs and converting collecting data ready for use.
The CSS/design was quickly mocked up to show the JavaScript components at work.
